# üïäÔ∏è Palombe [![cargo version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/palombe.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/palombe)

Palombe lets you send and receive key/value messages synchronously through
different processes using named pipes.

## Quick example

```rust
extern create palombe;

fn main() {
    std::thread::spawn(|| send("foo", "bar"));
    assert_eq!(receive("foo"), "bar");
}
```

Aknowlegments
-------------

:warning: This tool is not suited for building soytware, it is intend to
be use only in rapid prototyping and first product development steps!

C-bindings that expose Palombe have no UTF8 support (because it uses
`CString` that are FFI-Safe), so `base64` could be a good encoding for
sharing complex datatypes ...

If you looking for a better / faster / saffer way to share typed (yes
you want that) data across different processes, take a look at
[GoogleProtocal Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) or
even better at [Cap‚Äôn Proto](https://capnproto.org/) (which is
infinitely faster).
